<h3>The Sketch</h3>
This is the sketch I originally came up with<br>
![Magic Mirror Sketch](p2.Sheila.Stegman.png?raw=true)
<br>I wanted to use eye tracking as the form of interaction because I don't like the idea of getting fingerprints everywhere. As for the information I wanted to display, I wanted to show things most people would want to know every day. That includes the date and time, health information, the news, and social media.

<h3>The Gif</h3>

<br>Here you can see the mirror in action. I utilized color cordination to group similar information together. The "+" buttons are used to show more information in addition to the current info. 

<h3>Presentation</h3>
For a short presentation, you can view the file called "p2.Sheila.Stegman.mp4" in the gitHub repository.
Thank you for your time.

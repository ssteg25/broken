#The Sketch
This is the sketch I originally came up with <br />
![Magic Mirror Sketch](https://github.com/ssteg25/p2.Sheila.Stegman/blob/main/PELpanelOutside.png?raw=true)
I wanted to use eye tracking as the form of interaction because I don't like the idea of getting fingerprints everywhere. As for the information I wanted to display, I wanted to show things most people would want to know every day. That includes the date and time, health information, the news, and social media.

# The Gif
Here you can see the mirror in action. I utilized color cordination to group similar information together. The "+" buttons are used to show more information in addition to the current info. 

#Presentation
For a short presentation, you can view the file called "p2.Sheila.Stegman.mp4" in the gitHub repository.
Thank you for your time.
